These are the functionalities i implemented in the code, as well as the ones i tried but failed. The game still runs and that is the reason i included them.

** The starting level has an empty slot in the surrounding wall. This slot should function as a door into the level called "aSharpPlace." Implement the door functionality so that the player can proceed to the next level.

** Create a new level (a third level) and link the unused door in "aSharpPlace" to exit into the new room.

** In "aSharpPlace," implement teleport functionality for the "♨︎" symbols. Entering one should move the player to the other. 
NOTE: Failed to implement, but left the code i tried to use to solve this in the code as game still works

** Make the X NPC characters perform a simple patrol (+/-2 from their starting locations).

Give the NPCs stats, such as strength and hitpoints.
NOTE: Gave stats, but didn't get to use them for anything
